This repository is a small attempt to see the creation of [Espresso][] [Sugars][]
standardized.

You are under no obligation to follow the conventions documented herein, but
my hope is that if most of us Sugar developers do so, that the vast majority
of Espresso themes will play well with the vast majority of Espresso Sugars.

Ownership
---------
Primarily, this is a repository created by myself (elliottcable) to display
openly the reasoning behind the naming system I plan to follow in my
[Ruby][Ruby.sugar] and [Regex][Regex.sugar] Sugars. If themers want their
themes to work with any sugar I write, they'll have to adhere to parts of this
standard; and if other Sugar developers find it acceptable, they too can
benefit from themers adhering to this standard by conforming to this standard
as well.

Contributions / comments are well accepted, please, let me know what you think.
Although I'm going to personally maintain this document, I'm certainly open to
other points of view (though I may not change the standard to match those
points of view unless I consider them especially compelling).
