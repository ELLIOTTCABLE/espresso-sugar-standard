Espresso Sugar Standards
========================
This repository is a small attempt to see the creation of Espresso sugars
standardized.

You are under no obligation to follow the naming conventions indicated herein,
but the hope is that if most of us do so, that the vast majority of Espresso
themes will play well with the vast majority of Espresso Sugars.

Ownership
---------
Primarily, this is a repository created by myself (elliottcable) to display
openly the reasoning behind the naming system I plan to follow in the
[Ruby.sugar](http://github.com/elliottcable/ruby.sugar/ "elliottcable's Ruby.sugar on GitHub").
If themers want their themes to work with the Ruby sugar, or indeed, any sugar
I write, they'll have to (at least to some extent) adhere to parts of this
standard; and if other Sugar developers find it acceptable, they too can
benefit from themers adhering to this standard.

Contributions / comments are well accepted, please, let me know what you think.
Although I'm going to personally maintain this document, I'm certainly open to
other points of view (though I may not change the standard to match those
points of view unless I consider them especially compelling).

Commenting
----------
One thing worth noting - if you want to comment on the document's changesets
please do so using GitHub's commenting system:

- Comment on the appropriate line or section.
  - If your comment is about a specific identifier, comment on that
    identifier's line
  - If your comment is about a specific section, comment on that section's
    header's line
  - If your comment is about the structure / conceptualization of the entire
    document at the stage of a given commit, comment on the entire commit
- Don't enumerate all of your points / arguments in a single comment, it's a
  real pain to read - instead, split it up among the relevant lines or
  sections if at all possible
